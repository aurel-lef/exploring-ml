Self-practice with machine learning and cloud computing  

My objective is to perform full dataset analyses, each time trying different approaches/technos/computing platform.  
For now, I started with the famous [Titanic kaggle dataset](./kaggle-titanic-dataset/Titanic.md) with different angles: scikit-learn & pyspark in local, pyspark on a google dataproc cluster, deployment of a trained model in a webapi hosted on google Cloud Run.
